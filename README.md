# Getting Started with DuckyEvents 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Accessing the project from the web
If you do not wish to run the code locally, you can access the project at this link:
[link](https://react-auth-tutorial-ratoiman.web.app/)\
Please, keep in mind that you will have to create an accoount to use the app. If you do not wish to create one, you can use a dummy one that I created for demonstrating the app.

`email: admin@gmail.com`\
`password: admin1`

## Running the project


### `1. Installing packages`
Please run `npm install --force` before running the project.\
The `--force` flag is necessary because some installed packages were not updated to include react 18.0 in their dependencies, but this doesn't create any problems in running the app.
<br/><br/>

### `1.1 API key`
If you cloned this project from github, you will need to unzip the zip file provided in the submission and copy the `.env.local` file in the main folder of the project. This file contains the API key and is not pushed to git to avoid any privacy risks.  
<br/><br/>

### `2. Starting the project`
Please run `npm run start`, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`\
Port number may vary, once you run the console command, npm should print the exact link
<br/><br/>

### `3. Enjoy :)`
Thank you for viewing my project, hope you will enjoy it!
